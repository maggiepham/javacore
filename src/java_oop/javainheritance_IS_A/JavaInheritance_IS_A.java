	 * Inheritance (IS-A relationship) which is known as a parent-child relationship
	 * is an object to inherit attributes and methods / properties & behaviors from one class to another by using "extends" keyword
	 * create new classes that are built upon existing classes.
	 * when a new class is inherited from an existing class, it can reuse methods/fields from parent class. Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your current class
	 * 
	 */
	
	/*
	 * Why use inheritance
	 * for Method Overriding (so runtime polymorphism can be achieved)
	 * for Code Reusability
	 */
	
	/*
	 * Terms used in Inheritance
	 * Class: is a group of objects which have common properties
	 * Sub class/Child class : is inherited the other class
	 * Super class /parent class : is the class from where a subclass inherits the features
	 * Reusability : reuse the fields/ methods of the existing class when you create a new class
	 * Example : Employee, Programmer classes

	 * Types of inheritance in java
	 * There are 3 types of inheritance in java: single, multilevel, hierarchical
	 * multiple and hybrid inhertance is supported through interface only
	 * Single : Class B -> Class A (Ex. Animal, Dog, TestInheritance classes)
	 * Multilevel : Class C -> Class B -> Class A (Ex. Animal, Dog, BabyDog, TestInheritance2
	 * Hierarchical : Class B, Class C -> Class A
	 * 
	 * Multiple inheritance is not supported in Java through class
	 * Multiple : Class C -> Class A, Class B
	 * Hybrid : Class D -> Class B, Class C -> Class A
